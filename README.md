How to farm more coins and level up? Many people wonder how to earn more coins in TonCoin. Today we will look at several methods for speeding up farming.
In order to start earning TonCoin, you need to download the "ClickerTon" file
Effective initial leveling tactics:

First we pump up energy recovery, then volume, and then strength.
Here are a few tactics that are popular now:
1. ‚ùé No autoclicker

This tactic is suitable for use on the main account, as it has no chance of being blocked.

In order to implement this strategy as effectively as possible, you need to correctly calculate the time of transition to the tapbot, since it works quite specifically.

2. üîÑ Autoclicker (2 modes)
   
Here we replace manual farming with an autoclicker, and leave the tactics of using a tapbot the same, or remove it altogether (so farming will become 24 hours).

You can use absolutely any autoclicker, but I‚Äôll use the patched PerfectClick

After installation, we need to create a new script and insert the code there, which must first be corrected.

There are 2 autoclicker options:

one With auto-catching missiles(burn in the release)

two Without auto-catching missiles (burn in the release)

Without auto-fishing, there is less load on the device and faster clicks.

When going to the scripts, the text will indicate the parameters to change; to find out your screen width and height, select the ‚ÄúEdropper‚Äù in PerfectClick and move the slider to the lower right edge of the screen, remembering the first 2 numbers.

Also open TonCoin and move the slider to the center of the blue coin to click and remember its coordinates by entering it in the appropriate place in the script.
Once configured, you will have a stand-alone clicker with or without auto-catching as desired.
